# Feature Specification: Excel Data Encryptor Web UI

**Feature Branch**: `001-develop-a-web`
**Created**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "develop a web UI to allow user to upload excel and csv file, it should be able to ecrypted all data values for First name, Last Name, Mobile, and Email Columns, with SHA-256 . the user should be able to download the encrypt files from UI . the design is attached [Image #1]"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-02

- Q: How should the system handle column name variations? → A: Fuzzy match - handle variations like "FirstName", "First_Name", "firstname", "Email Address", "E-mail", etc. by normalizing spaces, underscores, dashes, and case
- Q: How should the system handle Excel files with multiple sheets? → A: Process only the first sheet and ignore all others
- Q: How should the system handle empty cells in target columns? → A: Skip encryption - leave empty cells empty, only hash non-empty values
- Q: What is the maximum file size the system should support? → A: 100MB - large datasets (~1M rows)
- Q: How should the downloaded encrypted file be named? → A: Timestamp suffix - "originalname_2025-10-02_encrypted.xlsx"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

A user has a spreadsheet (Excel or CSV file) containing sensitive personal information including first names, last names, mobile numbers, and email addresses. They need to anonymize this data using SHA-256 hashing for data protection compliance or testing purposes. The user visits the web application, uploads their file, and receives an encrypted version where the specified columns have been hashed. All processing happens client-side in the browser for security.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the user has an Excel file (.xlsx or .xls) with columns "First Name", "Last Name", "Mobile", and "Email", **When** they upload the file through the web interface, **Then** the system processes the file and allows them to download an encrypted version where all values in those four columns are replaced with their SHA-256 hash values

2. **Given** the user has a CSV file with the same target columns, **When** they upload the CSV file, **Then** the system processes it identically to Excel files and provides a downloadable encrypted CSV

3. **Given** the user uploads a file, **When** they click the "Encrypt & Download" button, **Then** the system encrypts the specified columns using SHA-256 and automatically triggers a download of the encrypted file

4. **Given** the user is on the upload page, **When** they drag and drop a supported file onto the upload area, **Then** the file is accepted and ready for encryption

5. **Given** a file has been uploaded, **When** the user views the interface, **Then** they can see the file name and status before clicking encrypt

### Edge Cases

- What happens when an uploaded file doesn't contain one or more of the target columns (First Name, Last Name, Mobile, Email)?
- System handles column name variations through fuzzy matching (normalizing spaces, underscores, dashes, case)
- Empty cells in target columns remain empty (only non-empty values are hashed)
- Maximum supported file size is 100MB (approximately 1M rows)
- What happens if the user tries to upload an unsupported file format (e.g., .doc, .pdf)?
- Excel files with multiple sheets: only the first sheet is processed, others are ignored
- What happens if the user clicks "Encrypt & Download" without uploading a file first?
- How does the system handle special characters, emojis, or non-ASCII characters in the data values?
- What happens when column headers have extra spaces or different capitalization?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a web interface accessible through a browser for file upload and download operations

- **FR-002**: System MUST accept Excel files in .xlsx and .xls formats via drag-and-drop or click-to-browse upload mechanism

- **FR-003**: System MUST accept CSV files via drag-and-drop or click-to-browse upload mechanism

- **FR-004**: System MUST identify and encrypt all data values in columns named "First Name", "Last Name", "Mobile", and "Email"

- **FR-005**: System MUST use SHA-256 hashing algorithm for encrypting the specified column values

- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve all other columns and their data without modification

- **FR-007**: System MUST preserve the original file structure (row count, column order, non-target columns)

- **FR-008**: System MUST generate a downloadable file in the same format as the uploaded file (Excel in → Excel out, CSV in → CSV out)

- **FR-009**: System MUST perform all file processing client-side in the browser without sending data to any server

- **FR-010**: System MUST display the uploaded file name to the user before encryption [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should system show file details like size, row count, or preview?]

- **FR-011**: System MUST provide a single "Encrypt & Download" button that triggers both encryption and download

- **FR-012**: System MUST leave empty cells in target columns unchanged (empty cells remain empty, only non-empty values are hashed)

- **FR-013**: System MUST display informational notes about SHA-256 being one-way (cannot be decrypted), suitability for anonymization, and client-side processing

- **FR-014**: System MUST validate file format before processing [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What error message should users see for unsupported formats?]

- **FR-015**: System MUST use fuzzy matching for column names by normalizing variations (removing spaces, underscores, dashes, and converting to lowercase) to match target columns "First Name", "Last Name", "Mobile", and "Email". Examples: "FirstName", "first_name", "FIRST-NAME", "Email Address", "E-mail" should all be recognized

- **FR-016**: System MUST process only the first sheet of Excel files with multiple sheets, ignoring all other sheets in the workbook

- **FR-017**: System MUST provide visual feedback during file processing [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should there be a progress bar, spinner, or percentage indicator?]

- **FR-018**: System MUST name the downloaded file using the pattern "[originalname]_[YYYY-MM-DD]_encrypted.[extension]" where the date is the processing date (e.g., "data_2025-10-02_encrypted.xlsx")

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: System MUST process files up to 100MB without crashing or freezing the browser

- **NFR-002**: System MUST encrypt files at a rate of at least 500ms per MB as per constitution performance standards

- **NFR-003**: System MUST provide user feedback within 100ms of user interactions (button clicks, file drops)

- **NFR-004**: System MUST work on modern browsers [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which browsers and versions? Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge?]

- **NFR-005**: System MUST be responsive and work on different screen sizes [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Mobile support required? Tablet support?]

- **NFR-006**: System MUST handle Unicode and international characters correctly in data values

- **NFR-007**: System interface MUST match the provided design mockup with the blue theme and lock icon branding

### Key Entities

- **Upload File**: Represents the Excel or CSV file uploaded by the user, containing source data with sensitive columns

- **Target Column**: Represents one of the four columns to be encrypted (First Name, Last Name, Mobile, Email)

- **Encrypted File**: Represents the processed file with target columns hashed using SHA-256, ready for download

- **Hash Value**: The SHA-256 output (64-character hexadecimal string) that replaces original sensitive data

## Notes

**Design Reference**: The UI design shows a clean interface with:
- Header with lock icon and "Excel Data Encryptor" title
- Description text explaining the upload functionality
- Large dashed-border upload area with upload icon
- File type specification (Excel files .xlsx, .xls)
- Prominent blue "Encrypt & Download" button
- Important notes section explaining SHA-256 characteristics

**Assumptions**:
- Client-side processing is explicitly required (noted in design: "All processing happens in your browser")
- No server-side storage or processing
- No user authentication or session management needed
- Single-page application workflow
