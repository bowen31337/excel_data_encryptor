# Excel Data Encryptor Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Standards

All code MUST meet the following non-negotiable quality criteria:

- **Readability First**: Code MUST be self-documenting with clear variable names, function names, and logical structure. Complex logic MUST include explanatory comments.
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function, class, or module MUST have one clear purpose. Functions exceeding 50 lines require explicit justification.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Duplicate code blocks (>5 lines appearing 2+ times) MUST be refactored into reusable functions or modules.
- **Type Safety**: All functions MUST have explicit type annotations (Python: type hints, TypeScript: strict mode, etc.). Dynamic typing MUST be justified and documented.
- **Error Handling**: All potential failure points MUST have explicit error handling. Silent failures are prohibited.
- **Code Reviews**: All changes MUST pass peer review before merging. Reviewers MUST verify adherence to these principles.

**Rationale**: High-quality code reduces bugs, improves maintainability, and enables team collaboration. Security-sensitive applications like encryption tools require exceptional code clarity to enable security audits.

### II. Testing Discipline (Non-Negotiable)

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is MANDATORY for all features:

- **Red-Green-Refactor Cycle**: Tests MUST be written first, MUST fail initially, then implementation makes them pass.
- **Test Coverage Requirements**:
  - Unit test coverage MUST be ≥80% for all business logic
  - Critical paths (encryption, decryption, key management) MUST have 100% coverage
  - All public APIs MUST have contract tests
  - Integration tests MUST cover all user-facing workflows
- **Test Quality Standards**:
  - Each test MUST verify one specific behavior
  - Test names MUST clearly describe what is being tested (Given-When-Then format preferred)
  - Tests MUST be independent (no shared state between tests)
  - Flaky tests MUST be fixed or removed immediately
- **Performance Testing**: Features with performance requirements MUST have automated performance tests with clear thresholds.

**Rationale**: TDD ensures requirements are clear before implementation, reduces debugging time, and provides living documentation. For encryption software, comprehensive testing is critical for security and correctness.

### III. User Experience Consistency

User-facing functionality MUST provide a consistent, predictable experience:

- **Interface Consistency**:
  - CLI commands MUST follow consistent patterns (verb-noun structure)
  - API endpoints MUST follow RESTful conventions
  - Error messages MUST be actionable and consistent in format
  - Success responses MUST include clear confirmation of actions taken
- **Input/Output Standards**:
  - All CLI tools MUST support both human-readable and JSON output formats
  - All inputs MUST be validated with clear error messages for invalid data
  - Progress indicators MUST be shown for operations >2 seconds
  - All outputs MUST be logged for audit purposes
- **Documentation Requirements**:
  - Every user-facing feature MUST have usage examples
  - Error scenarios MUST be documented with resolution steps
  - Breaking changes MUST be documented in CHANGELOG.md with migration guides

**Rationale**: Consistent UX reduces user errors, improves adoption, and minimizes support burden. For encryption tools handling sensitive data, clear communication prevents data loss.

### IV. Performance Requirements

All implementations MUST meet measurable performance standards:

- **Response Time Targets**:
  - File encryption/decryption: <500ms per MB of data
  - Key generation: <100ms
  - API endpoints: <200ms p95 latency for metadata operations
  - CLI commands: <50ms startup time for simple operations
- **Resource Constraints**:
  - Memory usage: <100MB baseline, <500MB for large file operations
  - CPU usage: MUST not peg CPU at 100% for >5 seconds (implement async processing for long operations)
  - Disk I/O: MUST use streaming for files >10MB
- **Scalability**:
  - MUST handle files up to 1GB without crashes
  - Batch operations MUST support parallel processing
  - Performance MUST degrade linearly with input size (no exponential complexity)

**Performance Test Requirements**: Every feature with performance requirements MUST include automated benchmarks that fail if thresholds are exceeded.

**Rationale**: Poor performance leads to poor user experience and may indicate inefficient algorithms. For file encryption, performance directly impacts usability.

### V. Security & Data Protection

Security is paramount for encryption software:

- **Secure by Default**:
  - No plaintext storage of sensitive data (keys, passwords)
  - All cryptographic operations MUST use industry-standard libraries (no custom crypto)
  - Secure deletion MUST overwrite sensitive data in memory after use
- **Input Validation**:
  - All external inputs MUST be validated and sanitized
  - File paths MUST be validated to prevent directory traversal
  - Command injection vectors MUST be eliminated
- **Audit Trail**:
  - All security-relevant operations MUST be logged
  - Logs MUST NOT contain sensitive data (keys, plaintext)
  - Failed authentication/authorization attempts MUST be logged
- **Dependency Management**:
  - All dependencies MUST be tracked with exact versions
  - Security vulnerabilities MUST be addressed within 7 days of disclosure
  - Dependency updates MUST be tested before merging

**Rationale**: Security vulnerabilities in encryption software can compromise user data. Defense-in-depth and secure coding practices are non-negotiable.

## Performance Standards

All features MUST be benchmarked against these standards:

- **Throughput**: Encryption throughput MUST be ≥10MB/s on standard hardware (2GHz CPU, 8GB RAM)
- **Latency**: User-initiated operations MUST provide feedback within 100ms
- **Reliability**: Crash rate MUST be <0.01% for valid inputs
- **Resource Efficiency**: MUST support concurrent operations without degradation until 80% of system resources are consumed

Performance regressions >10% MUST be justified or reverted.

## Development Workflow

### Quality Gates

All pull requests MUST pass these gates before merging:

1. **Automated Checks**:
   - All tests pass (unit, integration, contract)
   - Code coverage meets thresholds
   - Linter passes with zero errors
   - Type checker passes with zero errors
   - Security scanner passes (no high/critical vulnerabilities)
   - Performance benchmarks pass

2. **Code Review Requirements**:
   - At least one approving review from a team member
   - All reviewer comments addressed or acknowledged
   - Constitution compliance verified by reviewer
   - No unresolved merge conflicts

3. **Documentation Requirements**:
   - User-facing changes documented in appropriate locations
   - Breaking changes noted in CHANGELOG.md
   - API changes reflected in API documentation

### Branch Protection

- `main` branch MUST be protected (no direct commits)
- Force pushes to `main` are PROHIBITED
- All changes MUST go through pull request workflow
- CI/CD pipeline MUST pass before merge

### Versioning Policy

Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) MUST be used:

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes to public APIs or data formats
- **MINOR**: New features added in backward-compatible manner
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, performance improvements, security patches

Breaking changes MUST include deprecation warnings in the prior minor version when possible.

## Governance

### Constitutional Authority

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and conventions. When conflicts arise:

1. Constitution principles take precedence
2. Technical decisions MUST be justified against these principles
3. Exceptions MUST be documented with clear rationale in code comments and pull request descriptions

### Amendment Process

Constitution amendments require:

1. Written proposal documenting the change and rationale
2. Team review and approval
3. Migration plan for existing code (if applicable)
4. Version bump according to semantic versioning:
   - MAJOR: Removing principles or making backward-incompatible governance changes
   - MINOR: Adding new principles or materially expanding existing ones
   - PATCH: Clarifications, wording improvements, non-semantic refinements

### Compliance Review

- All pull requests MUST include a constitution compliance check
- Quarterly reviews MUST assess overall adherence to principles
- Non-compliance MUST result in immediate remediation or documented exception

### Continuous Improvement

Teams SHOULD:

- Propose improvements based on practical experience
- Share learnings from incidents or near-misses
- Update constitution as project needs evolve
- Balance principle adherence with pragmatic delivery

Complexity MUST be justified: If a solution violates a principle, document why simpler alternatives are insufficient.
